# Dodge_em_Car_Game
This was my Programming Fundamentals Project in 1st semester. As I hadn't studied any OOP and DS so the code looks messy but works.
It is a single player car game having enemies and points within a maze.
On Ubuntu for game execution:
First you have to install libraries by opening terminal in project folder and run a commad “ bash
install-libraries.sh”
then run “make” on terminal and it will create object files and game as out file.
To run the game write “./game” in terminal.
